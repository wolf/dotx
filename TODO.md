- [x] If ignore strings go into the context, do I have to pass the context into all my deeper-level functions?  I probably do anyway for DEBUG and VERBOSE settings.  (No, I can actually get the current context directly without passing it all the way down.  Wrote `is_debug_mode()` and friends to leverage this.  Too bad I had to test them by hand.)
- [x] Figure out how to test `options.is_debug_mode()` and friends (Click doesn't seem to want to do the right thing here, so tested by hand)
- [x] Collect all plans before executing _any_ plans
- [x] Collect a list of plans, one plan per package to be installed; then report all failures at the end
- [x] Set up logging
- [x] Check for leaf files existing, that should throw an exception: this install can't be done without destroying files

- [ ] Add docstrings everywhere
- [ ] Look at Sphinx (do I require MyST if I want to use Markdown?)
- [ ] Unit tests that look at deeper functions than just `plan_install`
- [ ] For testing, is there a better way of creating all these test files and test directories.  I'm fine with how I make the roots
- [ ] Log everything
- [ ] Add VERBOSE and DEBUG output
- [ ] Uninstall (feels like I can't do this with perfect fidelity)
  - [ ] Can I delete empty directories I _might_ have created during installation?
- [ ] What else goes in pyproject.toml?
- [ ] How good can I make ignore.py without it taking over the whole project?  Is ignoring single directories good enough for now?
- [ ] Usage?  Mark --target as required or else figure out what the default is.  Is it ${HOME}
- [ ] How best to _exit_ the program
