# Default patterns for directories that must be created (real directories, never symlinked)
#
# These are common shared directories where multiple programs/packages install files.
# If these were symlinks, only one package could use them.
#
# This file is shipped with dotx and can be overridden by:
#   ~/.config/dotx/always-create (user-specific additions)
#   <package>/.always-create (package-specific rules)
#
# Uses gitignore-style patterns with leading / to match only at root level:
#   /.config         - match .config at root only (not .config/subdir)
#   /.local/share    - match .local/share only (not .local/share/applications)

# XDG Base Directory specification directories
/.config
/.local
/.local/share
/.local/bin
/.cache

# Other common shared directories
/.ssh
/.gnupg
